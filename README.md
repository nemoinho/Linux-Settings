Linux-Settings
==============

Description
-----------
This project should collect the most important settings for my systems and
should help to care all my installed systems in a clear and transparent status.

I like to share these settings to everybody who is interessted into learning
something new. But I'll also like to get some good response. Therefore I share
this to all under the Beerware-license.

Installation
------------
To install these settings run this command

wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nemoinho/Linux-Settings/master/install.sh | bash

git is required for this!
